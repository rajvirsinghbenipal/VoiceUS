A major **technology failure** at United Airlines on August 6, 2025, brought air travel to a standstill across the United States. The glitch, rooted in the airline’s **weight and balance computer system**, forced the grounding of all domestic and international United flights for several hours.

By the time the issue was resolved, **more than 1,000 flights were delayed**, and dozens were canceled, leaving thousands of passengers stranded or scrambling to make alternative travel plans.

### What Caused the Glitch?

The problem originated in the **weight and balance system**, a critical piece of software that ensures aircraft are safely loaded before takeoff. Without it, planes cannot legally or safely depart.

> We experienced a temporary outage in a system that calculates weight and balance,” United said in an official statement. “Out of an abundance of caution, we held all aircraft at their origin airports until the issue was resolved.

Unlike typical IT problems, this issue directly affected flight operations and required coordination between airport crews, pilots, and airline dispatchers.

### Passenger Impact and Airport Chaos

The tech failure had ripple effects at major U.S. hubs including **Chicago O’Hare**, **Newark Liberty**, **San Francisco International**, and **Houston Bush Intercontinental**, where United maintains large operations.

- Long lines formed at ticketing and rebooking counters.
- Many travelers reported receiving little to no real-time updates.
- Airports were filled with passengers waiting for rescheduled flights, with some forced to stay overnight.

> It was total chaos,” said one traveler at Newark. “No one knew what was going on, and we just sat there for hours.

### FAA and Industry Response

The **Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)** confirmed it was in communication with United throughout the disruption. After verifying the issue was not related to **cybersecurity or external attacks**, the airline was cleared to resume operations.

Aviation experts have pointed out that as airlines rely more on digital infrastructure, incidents like these may become more common unless **robust failover systems** are in place.

### United’s Apology and Customer Support

United Airlines issued an apology and stated that customers affected by the glitch will be eligible for **travel waivers**, **refunds**, or **free rebooking** depending on their situation.

> We understand how frustrating this experience has been for our customers,” the airline said. “We’re offering flexibility and assistance to help travelers complete their journeys.

Affected passengers are encouraged to visit United’s support page or contact customer service directly.

### Final Thoughts
